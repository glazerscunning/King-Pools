<span>Professional version 2.6.0 of the plugin has introduced <strong>Google Recaptcha version 2</strong>. This is an easier and safer captcha, than the previously one used (Google Recaptcha version 1). Google Recaptcha version 2 is the default captcha selected, however you need to define </span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">site and secret keys</span><span> for your domain in the plugin's settings from </span><a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin">Google Recaptcha website</a><span>. To do this, you need to have a Google account. If you do not have a Google account, then you can use the alternative Google Recaptcha version 2 captcha, which does not require any keys or accounts, by setting </span><span style="background-color:rgb(220,255,220); font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">captchatype="RecaptchaV2 (no account)"</span><span> in your shortcode. Please note that this feature may not work in all cases. For backward compatibility you can still use Google Recaptcha version 1 captcha, by setting <em>captchatype="RecaptchaV1"</em> in your shortcode.</span>
