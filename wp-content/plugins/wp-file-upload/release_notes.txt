<span><strong>Latest release notes: </strong>This is an important release as it incorporates a very significant feature, <strong>relaxation of CSS rules</strong>. By default, the plugin's buttons and textboxes are styled to look the same in all themes. However, there are many users that want them to inherit the styles (colors, fonts, sizes) of the theme they are using. An option has been added in plugin's settings in Dashboard to relax the CSS rules. If enabled, then minimum styling will be applied on buttons and textboxes of the plugin, so that they inherit theme's styles.
